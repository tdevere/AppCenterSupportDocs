# Remove Project From Solution
## Recommended to use in appcenter-post-clone.sh

Why remove a project from your solution before build?
* You are trying to avoid a build issue with that project
* You want improved build performance by excluding projects which do not need to be rebuilt

This script requires the use of a [custom build variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/build/custom/variables/) to be configured. Build scripts within the contenxt of App Center have name and location requirements depending upon the build environment. For more details check out [build scripts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/build/custom/scripts/) and for an example project showing where to place each build script, check out [BuildScriptSample](https://github.com/tdevere/BuildScriptSample) The values of these do not matter but you may make them boolean: true/false to make them more understandable. 

* RemoveUWPProjects
* RemoveANDROIDProjects
* RemoveIOSProjects

``` Important Note ```
If you run into the error [Could not determine API level for $(TargetFrameworkVersion) of 'v12.0'](/Build/Could_not_determine_API_level_for_$TargetFrameworkVersion_of_v12.0.md), please try setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to a newer verision of the Java SDK.

In your App Center build configuration, add the build environment variables to enable removing each project types from the .SLN for that build.

Another consideration is to ensure that the search term will match your specific project name. In the same below, it's assumed that UWP, iOS, and Android will be in the name of each project file. [If your repo has more than one solution file, check out this solution for bash instead.](https://github.com/tdevere/bash_script#remove-projects-from-mulitple-solution-files-)

## PowerShell Example
In this example, a new consideration should be made. In the case of a shared project reference which should be built, you'll need to update the -Exclude option to avoid missing targets you actually require. In the sample below, that shared project is named "NU1503_Mobile_Project.csproj"

    write-host "appcenter-post-clone script: Remove Projects from Solution"
    write-host "Searching for Solution Files"

    $SLN_PATH = Get-ChildItem -Path $env:APPCENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY -Include *.sln 
    $AllProjects = Get-ChildItem -Path $env:APPCENTER_SOURCE_DIRECTORY -Include *.csproj -Exclude "*UWP*.csproj", "ServiceRequest.csproj" -Recurse
    write-host $SLN_PATH
    write-host $AllProjects
    foreach ($project in $AllProjects)
    {
        write-host "Removing $project from $SLN_PATH"
        dotnet sln $SLN_PATH remove $project
    }
